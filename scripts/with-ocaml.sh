#   2. $SWITCH                       — set it to force a particular switch
#   3. ./_opam                       — a switch local to this checkout
#   4. the global `writ` switch       — the central switch this project uses;
#                                      also what the VS Code OCaml extension finds
#   5. ../tryocaml, and the absolute path to it
#                                    — the sibling switch this repo was first
#                                      developed against, kept as a fallback
#
# Exists because the Makefile and editor/vscode/install.sh both need it, and a
# hardcoded switch path in the Makefile only ever worked on one machine.

error: no OCaml toolchain found — this project needs `dune`.

Either put dune on your PATH, or create a switch in this checkout:

    opam switch create . --deps-only    # or: opam switch create . 5.2.0
    opam install dune ocamlformat

If you already have a switch elsewhere, point at it:

    SWITCH=/path/to/switch make build
EOF
  exit 1
fi

exec "$@"

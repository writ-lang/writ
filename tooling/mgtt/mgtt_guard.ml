(* An mgtt predicate, written as a writ guard — and the search for an
   assignment realising one.

   The translation is set-valued, which is the part worth stating. A predicate
   like `connection_count < 500` does not name a member; it names the SET of
   members satisfying it, and the writ guard is the disjunction over that set.
   That the set is usually a singleton is a happy consequence of [Mgtt_domains]
   merging regions nothing separates, not something this module may assume.

   An empty set is a predicate no assignment satisfies. There is no `false` in
   the twenty-six words to write it with, and inventing one — `(and (is x m)
   (not (is x m)))` — would put a guard in the model that reads like a mistake.
   So it is refused here and becomes a decline, which is also the more useful
   answer: a state nothing can satisfy is an unreachable state, the same
   finding mgtt's own validate pass reports for a `triggered_by` label with no
   producer. *)
